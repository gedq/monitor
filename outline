The end result will be a <div> that appears on the screen like a old school green screen display.

It will have green text on a very dark grey background.

It will be able to take user input and display it.

It will be able to send user input back to the server

It will be able to output content to the <div> under program control.


1.  Appearance.
this from enjoy.css:
text-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255,255,255,1) , 0 0 20px rgba(255,255,255,1) , 0 0 30px rgba(255,255,255,1) , 0 0 40px #ff00de , 0 0 70px #ff00de , 0 0 80px #ff00de , 0 0 100px #ff00de ;
transition: all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1);
  
not sure transition is needed.

background colour is #111 foreground is whatever green text displays was.

I think I'm going to keep things simple and use a textarea.  Making it a form control, solving two issues in one step.


The function to add text to the display is javascript.  It will be fed a string and will display it on the screen.

I want a flashing line cursor.

I want the ability to delete text and retype it.  This is best achieved by having control tokens in the string.
